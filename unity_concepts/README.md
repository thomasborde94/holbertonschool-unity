### Task 3 - Physic Materials
#### Dynamic Friction
This property specifically controls the friction between two colliding dynamic objects (objects with rigidbodies that can move under physics simulation).
#### Static Friction
Static friction defines the friction between a dynamic object and a static object (like a floor or a wall).
#### Bounciness
Bounciness determines how much an object bounces off another object after a collision. A value of 0 means the object will not bounce at all (completely inelastic collision), while a value of 1 means it will bounce with full energy (completely elastic collision).
#### Friction Combine
This property determines how friction values are combined when two objects with different friction values collide.
#### Bounce Combine
Similar to friction combine, this property determines how bounciness values are combined when two colliding objects have different bounciness values.
